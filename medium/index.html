  <h1 class="h">Introducing Apex Ping</h1>

  <p class="p">
    I’d like to introduce Apex Ping! A minimalistic, but powerful uptime &
    performance monitoring service for websites and APIs. In this post I’ll
    cover features of Apex Ping, why I chose to build it first, and a few
    things I learned in the process. In future posts I’ll be detailing the
    implementation for anyone who is curious.<br>
    <br>
    I soft-launched Ping about a month ago, built almost 100% on AWS Lambda,
    with 500 users it has already detected over a million errors, and performed
    over 25 million checks. Big thanks to the early adopters who have checked
    it out!

  <h2 class="h">The product</h2>
  <p class="p">
  I’ve seen first-hand how embarrassing it can be when customers find out your
  product is having issues before you do, naturally this can translate to
  customers bailing on your product. Ensuring your site, app, or API is stable
  and performant is critical.<br>
  <br>
  Apex Ping helps by making sure your team is notified when there’s a
  performance regression, or when your end-point is down or unresponsive.
  Often people rely on “it works for me”, but Apex Ping’s reporting can help
  uncover the full story.
  </p>
  <h3 class="h">Powerful monitoring</h3>
  <p class="p">
  Unlike some other uptime monitoring services, which only support HEAD
  requests, Apex Ping support header fields and bodies as well. This allows
  you to test APIs, caching behaviour, and serving time, as well as the typical
  connection latency. <br>
  <br>

  The checks listing displays the uptime, mean response, Apdex score, and Adpex
  score throughout the day, week, or month. The Apdex score generalizes the
  user experience, summarizing response time satisfaction and error responses.

  <h2 class="h">Global checks</h2>
  <p class="p">
  Requests or “checks” are performed from a number of selectable
  PoPs (Point of Presence), giving you a glance at the customer experience all
  over the world. Hovering a PoP provides you with the breakdown, and coloring
  indicates their relative health so you can instantly see if a region’s
  availability or performance is degraded.<br>

  <h2 class="h"> Latency distribution</h2>
  <p class="p">
    When latency is a reflection of the user-experience, it’s important not to
    ignore the outliers. The Latency view provides you with an intuitive look
    at distribution throughout the selected time period, where the intensity of
    the heatmap represents the number of check’s within the given duration. <br>
  </p>

  <h2 class="h"> Errors & Apex</h2>
  <p class="p">
    The Apdex (Application Performance Index) score quantifies the
    user-experience based on a configured target latency.
    It effectively lets you know how far you are from hitting your mark,
    you should strive for a perfect 1.0!
  </p>
  <img src="tj_blog_img5.png" alt="apdex"><br>
  <h2 class="h">Timings</h2>
  <p class="p">
    Requests are comprised of several components such as DNS lookup,
    TCP connection, TLS handshake, followed by the response itself.
    If you’re experiencing performance issues the Timings view can
    help you out, showing you the distribution of each component.
